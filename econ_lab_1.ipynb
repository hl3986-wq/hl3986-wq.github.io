    "Each state in the union gets a number of points we call Electoral College votes. These point values are (partially) based on the population of that state as determined in the last census. During an election each state votes and the winner of the popular vote in a given state gets all of that state's EC votes. The candidate with the most EC votes after all states have voted, is the winner of the election. There are a couple of states that do not use this winner-take-all system but for simplicity sake, we will assume that all states do this. You can also make this assumption in your homework. In addition to the the 50 US states, the District of Columbia gets 3 EC votes, so there are 51 Electoral College races in all. The distribution of EC votes for the 2024 election may be seen [here](https://ballotpedia.org/Electoral_College_in_the_2024_presidential_election). It turns out that there are 538 EC votes. Notice that this is an even number! This means it may be possible for a tie to occur between two candidates if they each win 269 EC votes. Until pretty recently it was unknown just how likely this possibility was.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your current assignment you will use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the number of ways an Electoral College tie can occur. You will also consider the 2000 US Presidential Election and estimate the probabilities of victory or tie. To help get you started we will consider how to create some useful lists using list comprehension.\n",

    "The obvious truth is that the probability of a candidate winning a particular state is rarely 0.5. Create a list of 51 random values between 0 and 1 and pretend these are our best estimates for the probabilities that Candidate A wins in each state. So for example suppose there are only three states and the list looks like this `[0.4, 0.2, 0.6]`. What that means is that there is 0.4 probability that Candidate A wins state 1 and .2 that they win state 2, etc... Using this list of new probabilities, redo part 1. That is, use list comprehension to create a list of 51 `True` or `False` values where the values are now determined by Bernoulli trials each with the above associated probabilities.  "
